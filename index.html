Over the years, he has been humbled and amazed to see how extreme archery has grown from a simple idea into a worldwide sport that is enjoyed in 66 countries spanning six continents. As he travels around the United States and the globe, John witnesses the same phenomenon: people of all ages, genders, and nationalities enjoying the sport of extreme archery. To see people who never would have had the desire, inclination, or opportunity or pick up a bow and arrow out enjoying extreme archery is magical to John. He hopes the magic continues to grow.</p>

        <div class="littleBox"><strong>Archery Tag:</strong>  It is a unique sport that combines elements of dodgeball or other combat-type games with the timeless skills of archery. Players take aim at each other with our non-lethal arrows to score points or eliminate opposing team members. Our Archery Tag® 5-Spot Knock-Out Target adds an exciting dimension to game play</div><br>
        <div class="littleBox" id="rules"><strong>Rules:</strong> The combat archery sport game play is a combination of 3 other main sports which include, Dodgeball, Paintball, and Archery. Participants form teams of 5 and shoot at opponent large foam tip arrows using a bow .  To avoid injury, participants wear protective face masks and use bows with less than 30lb draw weight.The game's rules closely resemble dodgeball. The game begins with a number of arrows in the center of the arena. At the whistle, players race to collect them, before firing them at one another across the playing field. A player is eliminated if struck by an arrow, and a player can bring an eliminated teammate back into play by catching an arrow.</div><br>
